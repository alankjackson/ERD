##    Read and do initial processing on large Program Valid Registration file

FEMA applicant-level data for the Individuals and Households Program

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/ERD/Data/FEMA_HousingAssist/"

#   Read CSV, filter, and output

df <- read_csv(paste0(path, "IndividualsAndHouseholdsProgramValidRegistrations.csv"),
               col_types=stringr::str_dup("c", 71))

```

##    What can we filter out?

Looks like "Flood" is a good thing to filter on.

```{r}
unique(df$incidentType)

df <- df %>% 
  filter(incidentType=="Flood")

```
